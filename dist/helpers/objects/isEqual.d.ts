/**
 * Check whether two values are equal by value, however they are stored: two separately made arrays or objects with the
 * same contents are equal, while two references only need to be the same when the value is a function.
 * - Primitives are equal when they are the same value (and NaN equals NaN)
 * - Arrays are equal when they have the same elements in the same order
 * - Objects are equal when they have the same prototype (the same kind of object) and the same own properties with
 * equal values, the order of the properties does not matter
 * - Dates, regular expressions, Maps and Sets are compared by what they hold
 * - Circular references are handled: a pair of objects which is already being compared is taken to be equal
 * @memberOf module:objectHelpers
 * @param {*} first - The first value.
 * @param {*} second - The second value.
 * @returns {boolean} True when the values are equal.
